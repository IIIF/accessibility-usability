## 🧠 Problem or Use Case
Describe the situation or workflow where a new IIIF tool or feature would help.  
Who experiences this problem, and why does it matter?

_Example:_  
Instructors want to remix IIIF content for classroom exhibits, but manifests often break or are difficult to reuse.

## 🚧 Tooling Gap or Limitation
Explain what is missing or hard to do with current tools.  
Mention any partial solutions that exist.

_Example:_  
There is no easy way to crop and export IIIF regions between Exhibit.so and Scalar.

## 💡 Potential Solution or Project Idea
Describe the idea for a tool, plugin, or prototype that could address the issue.  
Leave space for others to suggest variations or improvements.

_Example:_  
A “Course Media Bridge” that syncs cropped IIIF regions and metadata between classroom tools.

## 👥 Stakeholders and Users
Who would benefit or might collaborate?  
List individuals, institutions, or working groups if relevant.

_Example:_  
Instructors, Exhibit.so developers, IIIF Outreach Working Group.

## 🚀 Hackathon Potential
If this idea could be explored in a hackathon, describe what a small team could achieve in a day or two.

_Example:_  
- Build a prototype crop-sync API  
- Create a basic front-end for testing interoperability
